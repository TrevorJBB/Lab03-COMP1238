Markdown allows you to style your text in many ways:  
**Bold** - Give **emphasis**.  
_Italic_ - _make your words tilted_.  
~~Strikethrough~~ - show the ~~removal~~ of thoughts.  
`backtick` - Bring more attention to `whatever` you like.  

MD also lets you display code blocks as well by doing the following:

```python
print("Hello, world!")
```  
## This is something cool that I found researching markdown tricks.  You can make a calendar, or really any kind of table.
